Moxidectin is a potent, broad-spectrum endectocide (antiparasitic active against endo- and ectoparasites) ([Cotreau 2003, Tan 2022](#main-references)). It is used to in the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis). It selectively binds to parasite GABA-A and glutamate-gated chloride ion channels, causing paralysis of the parasite. Moxidectin shows potential for the treatment of tuberculosis, but is currently not used in clinical practice for this indication. 

Moxidectin absorption reaches Tmax after 3-4h and shows a long half-life in humans ([Drugbank](#main-references)). Oral bioavailability is enhanced by lipids, but does not result in a clinically relevant food-drug interaction. The volume of distribution is 1.2 L/kg. Moxidectin is lipophilic and highly protein bound. Metabolism is mediated via CYP3A and CYP2B. Moxidectin is eliminated mainly in feces, with negligible renal elimination.

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for moxidectin in (healthy) adults. The aim of this work was to establish a model that can be used to evaluate moxidectin use in tuberculosis.

The presented moxidectin PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Moxidectin-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/COMPOUND-Model)).
