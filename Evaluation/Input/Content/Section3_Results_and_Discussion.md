The PBPK model for moxidectin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular ([Korth-Bradley 2012a, Korth-Bradley 2012b, Cotreau 2003, Kinrade 2018](#main-references))

* oral administration (solution or tablet)
* a dose range between 3 mg and 36 mg 
* fed and fasted state

The model quantifies metabolism via biliary clearance and CYP3A4. 

The PBPK model was able to capture the PK of moxidectin over the first days, but not the late phase as indicated by the GMFE. As the standard dosing regimen for tuberculosis is once daily (i.e., based on dosing regimens of other tuberculosis medicines, since moxidectin is not approved for tuberculosis yet), the model is fit for purpose to evaluate moxidectin in treatment of tuberculosis. Nevertheless, further model refinement is required to describe the late phase.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
